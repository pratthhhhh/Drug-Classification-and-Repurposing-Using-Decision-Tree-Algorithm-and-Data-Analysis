# Drug Classification and Repurposing Using Decision Tree Algorithm and Data Analysis

## Introduction

This project implements a machine learning solution for drug classification and drug repurposing using Decision Tree algorithms. The system analyzes drug properties and characteristics to classify drugs into appropriate categories and identify potential alternative therapeutic uses for existing drugs.

## Features

- **Drug Classification**: Classify drugs into different categories based on their chemical and biological properties
- **Decision Tree Algorithm**: Utilizes decision tree models for transparent and interpretable predictions
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) for drug datasets
- **Drug Repurposing**: Identify novel therapeutic applications for existing drugs
- **Visualization**: Generate insightful visualizations of drug properties and classification results

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pratthhhhh/Drug-Classification-and-Repurposing-Using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm-and-Data-Analysis.git
cd Drug-Classification-and-Repurposing-Using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm-and-Data-Analysis
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Main Application

```bash
python druggist.py
```

This will execute the main drug classification and analysis pipeline.

### Input Data

Prepare your dataset in CSV format with the following columns:
- Drug properties and features
- Classification labels

### Output

The application generates:
- Classification results
- Decision tree models
- Performance metrics and evaluation reports
- Visualization plots
