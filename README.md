# Drug Classification and Repurposing Using Decision Tree Algorithm and Data Analysis

## Features

- **Drug Classification**: Classify drugs into different categories based on their chemical and biological properties
- **Decision Tree Algorithm**: Utilizes decision tree models for transparent and interpretable predictions
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) for drug datasets
- **Drug Repurposing**: Identify novel therapeutic applications for existing drugs
- **Visualization**: Generate insightful visualizations of drug properties and classification results

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
